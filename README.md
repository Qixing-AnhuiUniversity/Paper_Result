   This is Qixing's github, which include the the experiment code and result of my research paper, with both my own method and the
method used for comparision.
  
   
   I am a lecture of Anhui University, China, and my research focus on motor control and artificial intelligence. If you find some errors in my statement, or if you are interest in my research, please contact to me. My email is 10031@ahu.edu.cn.
 
   
   My first paper: "Rotor resistance and excitation inductance estimation of induction motor using deep-q-learning algorithm", submited to "Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence". In this paper, I proposed an artificial intelligence method(Deep-Q Learning) to estimate induction motor's parameters, and I argued that as Deep-Q Learning method is a data-based strategy, it is superior to traditional model-based strategy in motor control applications, such as Model Reference Adaption System(MRAS), Extenal Kalman Filter(EKF), Least Square Method(LSM) and so on.
  
   
   In order to justify my argument, in the paper four comparision experiments were set up : 1, IEEE standard 211, the most common method, which is very familiar to the engineer, as it contains no-load test and rotor-locked test; 2, Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization(MPSO), one of my favorited methods, as it is quite simple but very effective; 3, A latest model-method: Least Square Method with Start-up Measurement(LSMSM); 4, Deep-Q Learning method(DQL). Because IEEE standard 211 is quite common, I think there is no need to open source it, so I just open source the other three method: MPSO, LSMSM and DQL. If the author of MPSO or LSMSM think it is inappropriate to open source it, or find some erros in the open source code, please contack to me, so I can delete it or revise it.
